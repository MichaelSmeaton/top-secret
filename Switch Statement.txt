Reasons:
                    1. Mentally less taxing to place a new feature in an existing class than to create a new class for the feature.
                    2. Caused by the gradual increase in the size of code, as code is always being added.
Strategy/approach:  Extract Method
                    Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
                    Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
